The purpose of this project is to make a deque.

In the main.cpp file, a menu type option should appear that will allow the user to choose what they want to happen in the data.


*** Test Files****

test.dat - this file contains text from "A Christmas Carol" which I gathered from project Gutenburg.

test2.dat - This is a blank file, so if you want to write some entries to it and print them out it much more simple to look at and see each string with its value.



**** Main Menu ****

Option 1: Create/set a data point
    - This option uses the set function to enter data into the BST.


Option 2: Find a data point
    - This option uses the find function to find the data point in the BST that the user wants.


Option 3: Print the BST
    - This option uses the print function to order the data in the BST and display it for the user.


Option 4: Finding the MIN
    - This uses the findMin function to search for the minimum or leftmost node to print.


Option 5: Finding the MAX
    - This uses the findMax function which searches for the maximum or rightmost node and prints it.


Option 6: Saving the BST
    - This uses the saveToFile function which will ask the user for the filename of which the data will be saved to.


Option 7: Delete/Remove a data point from the BST
    - This function uses the deleteNode function which finds the node based on the key input by the user and that node will then be deleted.


Option 8: Exiting the program
    - This option exits the program once you are finished.
    - You can use this to exit the program if you are having difficulties.
